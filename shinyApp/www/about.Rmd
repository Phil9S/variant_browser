## About

##### The MedGen variant browser (MGVB) is an intergrated platform for the viewing and querying of datasets within the Deptpartment of Medical   Genetics. All data here is confidential and incidental findings in other groups datasets should be reported to the appropriate group members. 


## Data Preparation

##### Data is prepared for viewing in a similar manner to the Javascript/MongoDB database used by ExAC running the db_prep.sh:
<br>
```{}
./db_prep.sh --loc /data/vcfs --anno annovar/file/path/anno --out
```
<br>

##### This requires the following unix software dependencies:

+ [vcftools](vcftools)
+ [GATK](gatk)
+ [annovar](annovar)
+ [bcftools](bcftools)
+ [tabix](tabix)

##### MGVB is primarily built in R using Rstudio's Shiny package which requires the following libraries:

+ stringr
+ shiny
+ markdown
+ shinythemes
+ ggplot2
+ DT
