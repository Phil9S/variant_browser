# variant_browser

A interactive browser for the exploration and interrogation of small nucleotide variants from WES datasets

## Shiny deployment
A limited functionality version of this application is deployed on the shinyapps.io cloud servers. Due to resource constraints and privacy issues the following features will not function correctly or been disabled:
* Sample data is non-functional
* Limited genomic variants (sub-sampled from original data)
* Anonymised clinical data
* Correlation and statistical testing of variant sites between cohorts

The application is hosted at https://phil9s.shinyapps.io/shinyappdeploy/


Free shiny apps have limited and non-persistent uptime so it may not always be available.
This app loads a significant amount of external data so may take up to a minute to initialise.
